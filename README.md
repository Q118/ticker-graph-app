A small real-world app that utilizes lightweight charts to graph the real-time price of tickers in the stock market that a user searches for using a financial data API.

User must be able to at LEAST search for a given ticker and have it graph the real-time price in the chart(at least a couple of days worth of prices will be needed to graph it)
